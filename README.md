# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! I'm a former Network Administrator with over five years of experience supporting IT infrastructure in the construction sector. My passion for network security, automation, and threat analysis led me to complete the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, and I'm actively growing my technical skills to transition into a cybersecurity analyst role.

## 🧠 About Me

As a Network Admin, I:

- Onboarded new employees by provisioning secure workstations and access credentials.
- Deployed and maintained network infrastructure on-site at oil refineries and depot locations.
- Managed user accounts and licensing in Office 365 using the Admin Center.
- Applied firewall filtering policies including IP blacklisting for threat mitigation.

Currently, I am:

- Practicing Python scripting for security automation. 
- Parsing and analyzing log files to detect anomalies and threats.
- Using SQL for basic security queries and data filtering.
- Learning Splunk for log correlation and dashboard building.

Through hands-on labs and real-world scenarios, I developed foundational Splunk engineering skills, including:

🔍 Search Mastery: Creating and fine-tuning queries to extract meaningful insights from logs.

📢 Alert Generation: Setting up alerts for specific events such as failed logins, unauthorized access, and port scanning attempts.

📊 Reporting: Designing custom reports to track security events and trends over time.

📈 Dashboard Management: Building and organizing dynamic dashboards for real-time monitoring of security incidents.

🧪 Use Case Implementation: Creating end-to-end solutions for log ingestion, parsing, correlation, and visualization.

I’m continuing to explore advanced Splunk topics like data onboarding, SPL optimization, and integration with threat intelligence feeds.

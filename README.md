# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! I'm a former Network Administrator with over five years of experience supporting IT infrastructure in the construction sector. My passion for network security, automation, and threat analysis led me to complete the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, and I'm actively growing my technical skills to transition into a cybersecurity analyst role.
